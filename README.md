##### Minimum Recommended Specifications

- **Go 1.10 or 1.11**
* Linux


  Installation instructions can be found here: https://golang.org/doc/install.
  It is recommended to add `$GOPATH/bin` to your `PATH` at this point.

#### setup
``cd ~/go/src/github.com/``

``https://github.com/beyondcoin-project/checkpoints-electrum-bynd.git``

``cd checkpoints-electrum``

``dep ensure`` 


dep is a dependency management tool for Go. It requires Go 1.9 or newer to compile.
https://github.com/golang/dep

### config.yml

change the host, port, username & password so it matches your RPC credentials. 

### Running the app

You can run the app by using the following command:

``go run main.go``

Or you can build the binary with the following command

``go build main.go``

This will produce a binary called "main" wich you can rename and for example upload 
on the server with scp as example. With the compiled binary, your linux
server/vps does not need the dependency's. The server/VPS that will run the binary
does not need to have Golang installed at all.

The machine that will compile does need Golang installed and all dependency's (use dep).
